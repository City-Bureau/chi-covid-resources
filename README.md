# Chicago COVID Resource Finder

[![Build status](https://github.com/City-Bureau/chi-covid-resources/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg)](https://github.com/City-Bureau/chi-covid-resources/actions)

Find updated, verified information on resources in the Chicago area during the coronavirus pandemic. Maintained by [City Bureau](https://www.citybureau.org/).

## Setup

You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and an [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) account set up with the fields in [`src/pages/index.js`](./src/pages/index.js).

The quickest and easiest way to make sure you have the fields required is to:

1. Clone this repository to a location of your choosing: `git clone https://github.com/City-Bureau/chi-covid-resources.git`

1. Make a copy of this Airtable [COVID Resource Finder base template](https://airtable.com/universe/expTcZwYlcgfz7c3U/covid-resource-finder-template). 

1. Copy the `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in the values with your Airtable [API key](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/219046777-How-do-I-get-my-API-key-) and information about your base. The minimum requirements to build the site correctly are values for AIRTABLE_BASE, AIRTABLE_KEY, and AIRTABLE_TABLE. You can also provide a value for the view, like so:
    ```
    AIRTABLE_BASE="appkz5EStpFHaq9jv"
    AIRTABLE_KEY="yourairtableapikey"
    AIRTABLE_TABLE="Directory"
    AIRTABLE_VIEW="Approved"
    REPORT_ERROR_PATH=
    ```
    Fetching and populating this data relies on the [gatsby-source-airtable](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-airtable/). 

1. To make sure that form submissions will work correctly,replace the `form-id` keys in `src/intl/` with the Airtable IDs of your forms. You can find the form ID at the end of the URL displayed in the "Share form" control of your form view `https://airtable.com/{FORM_ID}`.

1. Once you've set up the prerequisites, you can install dependencies and start a server at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

### Reporting Resource Errors

If you want to use the functionality for reporting errors with resources, you'll need to deploy an AWS Lambda function using the [`serverless-airtable-button`](https://github.com/City-Bureau/serverless-airtable-button) repo. Alternatively you can replace the custom form modal with an Airtable embed using the `AirtableEmbedModal` component and setting the `prefill_Resource` param in the `queryParams` property to prefill the flagged resource.

### Internationalization

Multilingual support is provided through [`gatsby-plugin-intl`](https://github.com/wiziple/gatsby-plugin-intl). Translated phrases are located in JSON files in the [`src/intl/`](./src/intl/) directory, and translated Markdown pages are in [`src/markdown/static`](./src/markdown/static/).

Some of the content is specific to City Bureau, but the majority of the translated phrases are not. You can configure which languages are displayed by modifying the `languages` array in [`gatsby-config.js`](./gatsby-config.js).

The Python script [`scripts/load_i18n.py`](./scripts/load_i18n.py) is used to load translated content directly from a publicly viewable Google Sheet with this structure:

| ID    | English | Spanish   |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| home  | Home    | Inicio    |
| about | About   | Acerca de |

To load the Spanish column's translations for all of the keys in the `KEYS` list, you'll need to set the `SPREADSHEET_ID` environment variable to the Google Sheet ID (found in the URL) and run:

```bash
make src/intl/i18n.csv
cat src/intl/i18n.csv | python scripts/load_i18n.py Spanish > src/intl/es.json
```

You can replace "Spanish" in the command with the column name that has completed translations.

## Deploy

To deploy the AWS S3 and Cloudfront, create an S3 bucket that allows static site hosting and a Cloudfront distribution pointing to the bucket's web hosting endpoint. Set the `S3_BUCKET` and `CLOUDFRONT_ID` environment variables with your bucket and distribution ID, and then with GNU Make and the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed run `make deploy`.

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in this Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

5.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

6.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

7.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

8. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

9. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

10. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
