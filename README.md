# Chicago COVID Resource Finder

[![Build status](https://github.com/City-Bureau/chi-covid-resources/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg)](https://github.com/City-Bureau/chi-covid-resources/actions)

Find updated, verified information on resources in the Chicago area during the coronavirus pandemic. Maintained by [City Bureau](https://www.citybureau.org/).

## Setup

You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and an [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) account set up with the fields in [`src/pages/index.js`](./src/pages/index.js).

Make a copy of the Airtable [COVID Resource Finder base template](https://airtable.com/universe/expTcZwYlcgfz7c3U/covid-resource-finder-template). Copy the `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in the values with your Airtable [API key](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/219046777-How-do-I-get-my-API-key-) and information about your base. Then make sure to replace the `form-id` keys in `src/intl/` with the Airtable IDs of your forms. 

Once you've set up the prerequisites, you can install dependencies and start a server at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### Reporting Resource Errors

If you want to use the functionality for reporting errors with resources, you'll need to deploy an AWS Lambda function using the [`serverless-airtable-button`](https://github.com/City-Bureau/serverless-airtable-button) repo. Alternatively you can replace the custom form modal with an Airtable embed using the `AirtableEmbedModal` component and setting the `prefill_Resource` param in the `queryParams` property to prefill the flagged resource.

## Deploy

To deploy the AWS S3 and Cloudfront, create an S3 bucket that allows static site hosting and a Cloudfront distribution pointing to the bucket's web hosting endpoint. Set the `S3_BUCKET` and `CLOUDFRONT_ID` environment variables with your bucket and distribution ID, and then with GNU Make installed run `make deploy`.

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

## üéì Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
