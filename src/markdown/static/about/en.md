# About

Chicago COVID Resource Finder was created to help people access updated, verified information for Chicago and Cook County during the coronavirus pandemic.

This website is created and maintained by [City Bureau](https://www.citybureau.org/), a nonprofit, nonpartisan journalism lab based on the South Side of Chicago. Our mission is to bring communities together to produce more equitable, impactful media.

This site will be regularly updated and translations to new languages are coming soon. If you want to suggest a new resource, submit a correction or update, go [here](/en/suggest-resource/) or email [info@citybureau.org](mailto:info@citybureau.org).

### Want to access this tool via text message?
